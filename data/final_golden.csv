466,Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is UP FOR IT today. He‚Äôs looked great for #Arsenal today.,1
467,"Another good #Arsenal break, but Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Bukayo Saka JUST can‚Äôt quite link up.",1
468,"Good break from #Arsenal, Odegaard picks out Thomas Partey, but he fires over. Tough take, that, running onto a bouncing ball and hitting it first time.",1
469,#Arsenal have gotten just a bit sloppy on the ball the past few minutes.,1

471,Starting to feel just a little bit like one of those #Arsenal are going to rue missed chances situations. Not enjoying this feeling.,1
472,"Bukayo Saka could have made it two. Bit of a fortunate bounce brings the ball back into his path, but his shot went just wide. Nice passing and movement from #Arsenal though.",1
473,Tierney smokes Lowton to get a cross in. Rough start for the Burnley man. Aubameyang beat him on the goal. #Arsenal,0
474,"Like that very much from Leno and #Arsenal. If Burnley are going to stack 3 men on the 18 for a goal kick, play it long (like he did there). Led to a break and a corner at the other end.",1
475,"Wrote earlier that it was really important for #Arsenal to get the first goal. Burnley are pretty good at shutting everything down if they get a lead, but they have scored the second fewest in the Premier League and struggle to come from behind. 

*touch wood*",1
476,"Cannot say enough about Thomas Partey. Made that goal out of a dodgy looking spot. Burnley were pressing quite high and were in a decent spot. Quick 1-2 between Partey and Xhaka, progressive pass to Willian, and a few seconds later, it‚Äôs 1-0 to #Arsenal.

Lovely stuff.",1
